# Rocketpay

### Payments API developed during Rocketseat NextLevel Week #4.
<hr>

### Server Setup

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


#### This is my first contact with Elixir and Phoenix. So some basic code will be found in exp (experiments) branches.
